# Banking-and-Polling
In each section (PyBank and PyPoll), there will be a "Resources" folder housing the csv files used, an "analysis" folder containing findings from the dataset, and a file called "main.py" with Python script used in order to perform analysis. 


*PyBank: Analyzing a financial dataset using Python to determine the following: 
  
  -The total number of months included in the dataset
  
  -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
  -The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  
  -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


*PyPoll: Analyzing poll data for the following:
  
  -The total number of votes cast
 
  -A complete list of candidates who received votes
  
  -The percentage of votes each candidate won
 
  -The total number of votes each candidate won
